# Weather Dashboard

## Description

The motivation of this project was to create an application that pulls weather data from an API called OpenWeather and displays it on the page per a city search. I built this project to practice pulling an API into a webpage to display data. I also built this to practice developing a web application completely from scratch while creating functions to create an interactive webpage. I learned how to fetch API calls to display data and create complex functions in order to connect built-in data inputs to information from APIs.
